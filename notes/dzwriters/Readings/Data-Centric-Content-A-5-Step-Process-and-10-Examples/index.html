A few weeks ago, ScrappingBee published 
<a href=https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/producthunt-cemetery/ rel=noopener><strong>a data-driven article</strong></a> analyzing how many of the startups launched in Product Hunt had since shut down.</p><p>It immediately blew up in Hacker News, a community for tech people, getting almost 200 upvotes and 100+ comments.</p><p>This also got ScrappingBee +150 backlinks from 50+ referring domains, some with high authority, like Crunchbase.</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbcb23e75f626b37b1a5_AebNSK-vLG_kBOmdw5YwU0u6lxmy3uwlOV9nOrA6MfNoRQIhc_fV3uduUG1MwdF3Z5P9LhKjI2L_Au_aBJlUAfhtT3ivme8CcGrA-suBA4lnu7e0kWQOzLN-yeht_WDH50aJdq5a.png alt="ScrappingBee&amp;rsquo;s article backlinks"></p><p>And while I don’t have the numbers, I’m sure that at least a small percentage of all this traffic they received converted into customers.</p><p>What’s the lesson here? Data-driven content gets social media shares, attracts backlinks, and can bring customers.</p><p>‍</p><a href=#what-is-data-centric-content><h2 id=what-is-data-centric-content><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is Data-Centric Content?</h2></a><p>Data-centric content (or data-driven content) focuses on factual information generated from research, experiments, surveys, and testing.</p><p>You know it’s data-centric content when it includes numbers, stats, and rankings. ScrappingBee’s article, for example, includes various stats like: “22% of products now produce some form of error”.</p><p>Data can be presented in lots of different ways, being the most common ones graphs, infographics, and interactive dashboards. ScrappingBee’s article, for example, includes lots of line, pie, and column charts backing their statements.</p><p>‍</p><a href=#why-do-data-centric-blog-posts-work><h2 id=why-do-data-centric-blog-posts-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Why do Data-Centric Blog Posts Work?</h2></a><p>The main reason is that people enjoy reading data. r/dataisbeautiful is a subreddit where users post data visualizations. It’s not surprising that it is Reddit’s 37th most-subscribed sub beating subreddits like r/personalfinance and r/technology.</p><p>Not only do people enjoy reading data, but it seems like they also enjoy sharing it. Data-centric content outperforms other types of content both in backlinks and social media shares obtained. 
<a href=https://www.link-assistant.com/news/link-building-strategies.html rel=noopener><strong>A survey conducted on 628 SEOs</strong></a> concluded that using data and research was the best way to build backlinks (see how I’m sharing data?).</p><p>Furthermore, it seems like data generates trust with the reader, which can improve conversion rates. We associate data in charts, graphs, and dashboards with science, and we naturally consider science trustworthy.</p><p>For all these reasons it’s why data-centric articles work so well in getting shares, backlinks, and clicks.</p><p>‍</p><a href=#how-to-create-a-data-driven-article><h2 id=how-to-create-a-data-driven-article><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How to Create a Data-Driven Article?</h2></a><a href=#1-find-a-data-centric-content-idea><h3 id=1-find-a-data-centric-content-idea><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1) Find a Data-Centric Content Idea</h3></a><p>Not all topic ideas are a good fit with data-centric content. Here are 3 strategies to find data-centric content ideas.</p><p>‍</p><a href=#3-strategies-to-find-data-centric-content-ideas><h4 id=3-strategies-to-find-data-centric-content-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3 Strategies to Find Data-Centric Content Ideas</h4></a><a href=#1-analyze-competition><h5 id=1-analyze-competition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1) Analyze Competition</h5></a><p>Search in competitors’ blogs and niche websites for their content with the most backlinks and social media shares, which will generally be data-centric content, if they have published any.</p><p>You can find which pages in a website have the most backlinks using Ahrefs. If you pay for the tool (you can get access for 7 days for $7), search for your competitor in “Site Explorer” and go to Pages > “Best by links”.</p><p>If you don’t have the tool, go to 
<a href=https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker rel=noopener><strong>their free Backlink Checker</strong></a>, paste your competitor’s URL and click on “Top 5 pages”. This is what I see when I enter Failory’s domain.</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbcb8fd98b61733294ef_7ZhSNKK36tSEF_zAeNNiGZXUWiVAIexOI2N6XfMOBpUEHYe2-dloUVY7I8s0NnXWRvdpWHV66UeRj_fCp_q1EK3kI7uC9I1wLvb2Dym1U6B2wE0tjEP30Lrf4kDhkHqumF4qJa2q.png alt="Failory&amp;rsquo;s most linked pages"></p><p>The second most-linked page, titled “Startup Failure Rate: How Many Startups Fail and Why?”, is a perfect data-centric content idea.</p><p>For finding the pages on a website with the biggest number of social media shares, you can use 
<a href=https://app.buzzsumo.com/content/web rel=noopener><strong>Buzzsumo’s free Content Analyzer</strong></a> or Ahrefs’ Content Explorer. This is what I see when searching “site:failory.com” in Ahrefs:</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbccf3343fb845418a93_6enklk7332MmHEO44OetjfsvNYFAAZjsHZsoEiMK7-88yQvvN8NgKeWujhnvbA110DNtqWCXsW9vAtxuu5E-fMC2xoKfKZ1yE96Gsh0-HZaDR4vnL92p_e4i4VnBMTYuyKSBe5XX.png alt="Failory&amp;rsquo;s most shared pages"></p><p>2nd, 3rd, and 4th pages are all good examples of data-centric content that a Failory competitor could be interested in writing about.</p><p>If you can’t afford to get Ahref’s or Buzzsumo’s trials, you can find your competitor’s data-centric articles by simply checking their blog (or all of their pages searching in Google “site:url.com”).</p><p>‍</p><a href=#2-industry-topic--stats--data><h5 id=2-industry-topic--stats--data><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2) Industry Topic + Stats / Data</h5></a><p>Create articles about stats or data related to different topics in your business’ industry or niche.</p><p>For example, for Failory I could create articles about “Startup Funding Stats” or “Startup Costs Stats”. When I search for these terms in Google, I see there’s a ton of data about it, so it’d simply be a matter of curating these stats in one blog post.</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbcb80acbb5309d35cae_MI6ChZtSI-iDnQK6P6awG-FZ1AD7dHmr3Tj0SDR6wNwPfXnqkzynnNcjvg44sTpuXgQ4V-Fx9bexQYvAprAWBHxHq5JYlQy50aHmK0IK49p67uCUqW4Grp-a1ScGddxG8fr4IPTq.png alt="Startup stats"></p><p>‍</p><a href=#3-stay-on-top-of-trends><h5 id=3-stay-on-top-of-trends><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3) Stay on Top of Trends</h5></a><p>Creating a data-centric piece of content focused on a hot trend or news can lead to immediate virality.</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic started, people ran to supermarkets to stock their houses with toilet paper. In this context, Ben Sassoon and Sam Harris created a website called “
<a href=https://howmuchtoiletpaper.com/ rel=noopener><strong>How Much Toilet Paper?!</strong></a>”, which used data to calculate how many days would the toilet paper last you based on the rolls you had, the number of times you visited the toilet, the number of people in your house, etc.</p><p>Combining data with a hot trend earned the website a mention in Jimmy Fallon’s TV show and the New York Post.</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbcb2149b31d90c919dd_S_T6c8VRTnOzCluv_h7aUkcxiVazxwz2IsSjS9azfc76J3dY9L8o-VmuA7mgXtCdQtqwkHz-YKc1k5roWwiVH-xBDvvCJTGuuHCL5CjW5g5nQoeF0tyA3_ulImujqHoTvP8M7eXH.png alt="How much toilet paper?"></p><p>Your content will probably not be about such a general and hot topic like the COVID-19, but it can be about an important industry event, or a new business practice, or a change in regulations, just to name a few common hot topics.</p><p>‍</p><a href=#data-centric-content-idea--seo><h4 id=data-centric-content-idea--seo><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Data-Centric Content Idea + SEO?</h4></a><p>It’s a good practice to optimize your data-centric content idea for SEO. This means finding keywords that your data-centric content can rank for. In that way, you don’t depend just on social media shares and backlinks for getting traffic.</p><p>To do this, search the topic idea you’ve come up with in Google and look for patterns in the titles and URLs of the pages covering a similar topic. You can also use Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer to search for your topic and find “Related Terms” or a “Parent Topic”.</p><p>For example, in the example mentioned above about Failory’s Startup Failure Rate report, I first came up with the idea of creating an article about the “Percentage of Startups that Fail”. However, when I checked the term in Ahrefs, I identified that the ranking pages were instead targeting the keywords “Startup Failure Rate” and “How Many Startups Fail”, so I re-oriented the piece to these two terms.</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fadb14c46b287ad224b60b9/6216fbcc097ca4e558d291d6_UQZ6oFVdXYd5HH9aSZlIlrEnDZChkuGGNu-Ri3M0Wav2O6iaoCBcD1suKLBwSojeeyX60WS5Gn1Rc_0BPci2RVuDun5rcgc1BzHxO3Imao6cSsmXZZp8LS9oAKOT7a-DTYxSrscz.png alt="SERP for &amp;ldquo;percentage of startups that fail&amp;rdquo;"></p><p>However, it’s fine if you can’t find any keywords that fit your data-centric content idea - it can still bring a lot of traffic from social media shares and backlinks on other websites. </p><p>ScrappingBee’s article about Product Hunt’s failed businesses ranks #1st for “Product Hunt Cemetery” but few people, if none zero, search for that term. Yet, they have got thousands of visitors in just a few days, which would have taken an article ranking for a competitive term in Google many months.</p><p>[</p><p>Ad</p><p><img src=https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5fada95bd7a18db677087e20/621d960c617ca70c34d3638c_Around%20Logo%202.png alt="Around Logo"></p><p>Video calls radically reimagined for the way startup teams REALLY work today. <strong>Try Around for Free →</strong></p><p>](
