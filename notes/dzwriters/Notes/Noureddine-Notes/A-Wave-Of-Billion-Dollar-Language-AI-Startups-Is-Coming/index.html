It therefore is and must be at the heart of our efforts to build artificial intelligence. No sophisticated AI can exist without mastery of language.</p><p>The field of language AI—also referred to as natural language processing, or NLP—has undergone breathtaking, unprecedented advances over the past few years.
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2022/02/13/language-is-the-next-great-frontier-in-ai/?sh=66bb30cf5c50" rel=noopener>Two related technology breakthroughs</a> have driven this remarkable recent progress: self-supervised learning and a powerful new deep learning architecture known as the transformer.</p><p>We now stand at an exhilarating inflection point. Next-generation language AI is poised to make the leap from academic research to widespread real-world adoption, generating many billions of dollars of value and transforming entire industries in the years ahead.</p><p>A nascent ecosystem of startups is at the vanguard of this technology revolution. These companies have begun to apply cutting-edge NLP across sectors with a wide range of different product visions and business models. Given language’s foundational importance throughout society and the economy, few areas of technology will have a more far-reaching impact in the years ahead.</p><a href=#1--horizontal-technology-providers><h1 id=1--horizontal-technology-providers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1- Horizontal Technology Providers</h1></a><p>The first category of language AI startups worth discussing is those players that develop and make available core general-purpose NLP technology for other organizations to apply across industries and use cases.</p><p>Building a state-of-the-art NLP model today is incredibly resource-intensive and technically challenging. As a result, very few companies or researchers actually build their own NLP models from scratch. Instead, virtually all advanced ==NLP in use today, no matter the industry or setting, is based on one of a small handful of massive pretrained language models==. Stanford researchers recently dubbed these pretrained models <a class="internal-link broken">foundation models</a>
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf rel=noopener>“foundation models”</a> in recognition of their outsize influence.</p><p>Most often, foundation models are built and open-sourced by the publicly traded technology giants—e.g., <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BERT rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BERT>BERT</a> from Google, <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/RoBERTa rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/RoBERTa>RoBERTa</a> from Facebook.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/OpenAI rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/OpenAI>OpenAI</a> is another important source of state-of-the-art NLP technology. Its large language model <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GPT-3 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GPT-3>GPT-3</a> is perhaps the most well-known and widely used foundation model today. <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GPT-3 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GPT-3>GPT-3</a> is a <a class="internal-link broken">generative model</a> (the G in its name stands for generative): it generates original text in response to prompts from human users. OpenAI
<a href=https://openai.com/api/ rel=noopener>has made</a> GPT-3 commercially available via API for use across applications, charging on a per-word basis.</p><p>Given Microsoft’s massive investments in and deep alliance with the organization, OpenAI can almost be considered an arm of the tech giant.</p><p>But there is also tremendous opportunity in this category for younger startups.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere>Cohere</a> is a fast-growing startup based in Toronto that, like OpenAI, develops cutting-edge NLP technology and makes it commercially available via API for use across industries. <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere>Cohere</a>’s founding team is highly pedigreed: CEO Aidan Gomez is one of the co-inventors of the <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/transformer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/transformer>transformer</a>; CTO Nick Frosst is a Geoff Hinton protégé. The company
<a href=https://betakit.com/cohere-closes-125-million-usd-series-b-round-led-by-tiger-global/ rel=noopener>recently announced</a> a large Series B fundraise from Tiger Global less than a year after emerging from stealth.</p><p>While <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere>Cohere</a> does produce generative models along the lines of GPT-3, the company is increasingly focused on models that analyze existing text rather than generate novel text. These classification models have myriad commercial use cases: from customer support to content moderation, from market analysis to search.</p><p>&ldquo;Language generation has seemingly monopolized the attention of those interested in NLP, but the most significant opportunity for developers interested in building NLP into their systems actually rests in language representation models like <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BERT rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BERT>BERT</a>,” said Gomez. “While slightly less &lsquo;miraculous&rsquo;, these models form the backbone of some of the most sophisticated NLP systems in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Another leading horizontal NLP startup is <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face>Hugging Face</a>. Hugging Face is a wildly popular community-based repository for open-source NLP technology. Unlike OpenAI or <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Cohere>Cohere</a>, <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face>Hugging Face</a> does not build its own NLP models. Rather, it is a platform that stores, serves and manages the latest and greatest in open-source NLP models, including enabling customers to fine-tune these models and deploy them at scale.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hugging-Face>Hugging Face</a>’s secret sauce is its community: it has become a go-to destination for companies and researchers in the world of <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/NLP rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/NLP>NLP</a> to collaborate. In this respect it can be loosely analogized to GitHub, but for machine learning rather than traditional software engineering.</p><p>Other horizontal NLP providers of note include <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/AI21-Labs rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/AI21-Labs>AI21 Labs</a> and <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Primer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Primer>Primer</a>.</p><p>Based in Israel, AI21 has a two-pronged business model: it offers proprietary large language models via API to power customers’ applications (its current state-of-the-art model, named Jurassic-1, is roughly the same size as GPT-3), and it also builds and commercializes its own applications on top of those models. Its current application suite focuses on tools to augment reading and writing.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Primer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Primer>Primer</a> is an older competitor in this space, founded two years before the invention of the <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/transformer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/transformer>transformer</a>. The company primarily serves clients in government and defense.</p><p>There is one last wild card worth mentioning in this category. Launched less than a month ago, little is known yet about
<a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/reid-hoffman-has-set-up-a-new-ai-company-with-deepminds-co-founder.html rel=noopener>[Inflection AI]</a> beyond its eye-catching founding team: Reid Hoffman, DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, and decorated DeepMind researcher Karen Simonyan. The company is being incubated at Greylock, where Hoffman is a general partner. Its stated mission is to “fundamentally redefine human-machine interaction” by enabling humans to “relay our thoughts and ideas to computers using the same natural, conversational language we use to communicate with people.”</p><p>Given the caliber of the company’s founders and backers, expect Inflection AI to make waves in the world of language AI before long.</p><a href=#2--search><h1 id=2--search><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2- Search</h1></a><p>The most basic way that humans use natural language to interface with machines is through search. It is the primary means by which we access and navigate digital information; it lies at the heart of the modern internet experience.</p><p>Search has been dominated by a single player for so long (Google) that it is often seen as an unpromising or ==even irrelevant category for startups==. But this is far from true.</p><p>Last month a blog post titled <a class="internal-link broken">Google Search Is Dying</a>
<a href=https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying rel=noopener>“Google Search Is Dying”</a> made the rounds and sparked widespread discussion. The post hit home with a simple point: an opportunity exists for an upstart to improve and disrupt the Google search experience.</p><p>The new entrant taking on Google most directly is <a class="internal-link broken">You.com</a>. Founded by <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Richard-Socher rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Richard-Socher>Richard Socher</a>, former Chief Scientist at Salesforce and one of the world’s
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=FaOcyfMAAAAJ" rel=noopener>most widely cited</a> NLP researchers, You.com is reconceptualizing the search engine from the ground up. Its product vision includes a horizontal layout, an emphasis on content summarization, and above all, a commitment to user data privacy.</p><p>Challenging Google directly will, to state the obvious, be an uphill battle. There is also significant opportunity for startups in search beyond the consumer internet search market with which Google has become synonymous.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/ZIR-AI rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/ZIR-AI>ZIR AI</a> is a young startup building a new search platform for enterprise. Leveraging the latest transformer-based techniques, ZIR is seeking to develop search technology with true ==semantic comprehension== (as opposed to keyword-based matching) and more sophisticated ==multilingual== capabilities. Like You.com, ZIR has a pedigreed founding team that includes former <a class="internal-link broken">Cloudera</a> CTO/cofounder <a class="internal-link broken">Amr Awadallah</a>.</p><p><a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Algolia rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Algolia>Algolia</a> is a more well-established player in enterprise search; the company has raised over==$300 million== in venture funding since graduating from <a class="internal-link broken">Y Combinator</a> in 2014. Algolia offers an API that enables its customers—from tech companies like Slack to media businesses like the Financial Times—to embed search experiences in their websites and applications. <a class="internal-link broken">Constructor.io</a> is another fast-growing competitor in this space that focuses specifically on ecommerce search and discovery.</p><p>One final enterprise search startup worth keeping an eye on is <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hebbia rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Hebbia>Hebbia</a>, which is building an AI research platform to enable companies to extract insights from their private unstructured data.</p><p>In the words of Hebbia founder/CEO George Sivulka: “==Google has only indexed 4% of the world’s online data==. We’re unleashing the other 96%.”</p><p>All of the companies mentioned above (including Google) focus on text search. But thanks to recent breakthroughs in AI, opportunities ==now exist for startups to build search tools for data modalities beyond text==—and no new modality represents a bigger opportunity than video.</p><p>Video has become the dominant medium for our digital lives. ==A whopping 80% of the data on the internet today is video==. Yet remarkably, ==there is no effective way to search through all this video content—to find, say, a particular moment, concept or discussion==. The range of potential commercial use cases for video search is basically endless: from social media to streaming content, from digital asset management to workplace productivity, from content moderation to cloud storage. <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/search-in-video rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/search-in-video>search in video</a></p><p>One exciting startup building next-generation video search capabilities is <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Twelve-Labs rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Twelve-Labs>Twelve Labs</a>, which

A less common approach is to develop contact center AI ==purpose-built== for a particular vertical. This is the approach taken by <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BirchAI rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/BirchAI>BirchAI</a>, a young startup that recently spun out of the Allen Institute for AI (AI2).

Language is a slippery, nuanced phenomenon; ==it is impossible to build an AI model today that can reliably detect every instance of fake news or sexual harassment==.

According to the company, its technology allows online platforms to increase detection of toxic behaviors by 10x while reducing content moderation efforts by 50% on average.</p><p>“The companies, communities and content creator ecosystems that take safety, privacy, and DEI seriously now are poised to be the leaders in the business world of tomorrow,” said Spectrum Labs cofounder/CEO Justin Davis. “In an area in which there is no definition of ‘done’, AI is one of many tools that can transform Trust & Safety teams into data-informed builders of brighter and more positive experiences.”</p><p>Another interesting player in this category is <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Logically rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Logically>Logically</a>.

From chatbots to search, it turns out that most language AI capabilities have broad horizontal applicability across industries. While opportunities for vertical-specific NLP applications do exist in some other industries, for instance financial services and law, no sector offers a greater breadth of language AI use cases than healthcare.</p><p>In part this is simply because healthcare is such a massive market: at
<a href=https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical rel=noopener>over $4 trillion</a>, it is the ==largest sector of the U.S. economy==, accounting for a staggering 19.7% of the country’s entire GDP. Healthcare-specific AI stacks and data pipelines also make sense given the stringent ==data privacy requirements== in healthcare, reflected in regulations like HIPAA. And the world of healthcare is full of specialized language and jargon, making health-specific NLP models important.</p><p>There is no one particular NLP “killer app” in healthcare; rather, startups have identified a wide range of different use cases to which language AI can be valuably applied.</p><p>One area that has seen a lot of startup activity in recent years is ==conversational AI for patient screening and care navigation==: in other words, chatbots that serve as patients’ “digital front doors” into the healthcare system. For instance, imagine a conversational interface with which patients can share symptoms and receive automated clinical guidance in response; or a chatbot that engages with patients on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain compliant with their care regimen.</p><p>==Using AI to automate these interactions can expand access to healthcare, reduce costs,== and streamline triage by making expert health guidance available without the need for human physicians’ expensive time. As is often the case in the world of NLP, a key design challenge here is how to navigate the handoff between AI and human respondents: how much of a patient conversation can be automated, and under what circumstances should a human clinician be looped in?</p><p>Promising startups building solutions in this space include <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GYANT rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/GYANT>GYANT</a>, <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Curai rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Curai>Curai</a> and <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Buoy-Health rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Buoy-Health>Buoy Health</a>.</p><p>A related application is <a class="internal-link broken">chatbots for mental health</a>, a use case that
<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/health/artificial-intelligence-therapy-woebot.html rel=noopener>has seen tremendous growth</a> during the pandemic. These “AI therapists” are freely available and immediately responsive via mobile app for individuals to discuss their lives and problems with. They do not represent a full clinical solution but rather one potentially useful tool for those in need.</p><p>While some clinicians and patients are uneasy about the idea of a machine providing mental health support, the fact is that we face a critical shortage of trained therapists and affordable mental healthcare today.

Given this reality, these AI-powered conversational agents may have an important role to play providing patients with support in an accessible, scalable way.</p><p>The leading startup building mental health chatbot technology is <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Woebot rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Woebot>Woebot</a>, which has raised close to $150 million to date from investors including NEA and Temasek.

It’s therapy you can take anywhere with you.” In the words of another Woebot user: “Having the possibility to chat anytime about my feelings has stopped some of the worst thoughts and spirals.”</p><p>Less high-profile Woebot competitors include <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Wysa rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/Wysa>Wysa</a> and <a href=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/X2AI rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quartz/notes/dzwriters/Notes/Noureddine-Notes/X2AI>X2AI</a>.</p><p>Another important pain point that NLP can help solve is ==navigating the vast troves of unstructured data in healthcare==.</p><p>Healthcare data is incredibly messy, as anyone who has been exposed to the modern healthcare system knows. Relevant clinical and ==pharmaceutical information is typically free-form, poorly organized and spread across disparate data sources, from siloed EHRs to difficult-to-edit PDFs==.
